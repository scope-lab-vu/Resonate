This directory contains datasets which can be used to reproduce the results from various Resonate papers/projects.
However, these datasets are not committed to Git due to their large size.
Instead, they are available on the Vanderbilt ALC Project Fileserver under "resonate-data".
For access information, contact charles.a.hartsell@vanderbilt.edu.
